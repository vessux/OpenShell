# Container Images

OpenShell produces two container images, both published for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

## Gateway (`openshell/gateway`)

The gateway runs the control plane API server. It is deployed as a StatefulSet inside the cluster container via a bundled Helm chart.

- **Docker target**: `gateway` in `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.images`
- **Registry**: `ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell/gateway:latest`
- **Pulled when**: Cluster startup (the Helm chart triggers the pull)
- **Entrypoint**: `openshell-gateway --port 8080` (gRPC + HTTP, mTLS)

## Cluster (`openshell/cluster`)

The cluster image is a single-container Kubernetes distribution that bundles the Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, and the `openshell-sandbox` supervisor binary needed to bootstrap the control plane.

- **Docker target**: `cluster` in `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.images`
- **Registry**: `ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell/cluster:latest`
- **Pulled when**: `openshell gateway start`

The supervisor binary (`openshell-sandbox`) is built before the image build, staged under `deploy/docker/.build/prebuilt-binaries/<arch>/`, and copied into the cluster image at `/opt/openshell/bin/openshell-sandbox`. It is exposed to sandbox pods at runtime via a read-only `hostPath` volume mount — it is not baked into sandbox images.

## Image Build Pipeline

`deploy/docker/Dockerfile.images` no longer compiles Rust. CI calls `.github/workflows/shadow-rust-native-build.yml` through `workflow_call` to build `openshell-gateway` or `openshell-sandbox` natively on the target architecture. `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` downloads the resulting artifact, stages it at `deploy/docker/.build/prebuilt-binaries/<arch>/`, builds the per-arch image with the local Buildx driver, and merges multi-arch pushes with `docker buildx imagetools create`. Callers normally publish the GitHub SHA tag, but shadow workflows can pass `image-tag` to publish isolated temporary tags for validation.

Local Docker builds use `tasks/scripts/stage-prebuilt-binaries.sh` through `tasks/scripts/docker-build-image.sh` before invoking Docker, so clean checkouts do not need to create the staging directory manually.

## Standalone Gateway Binary

OpenShell also publishes a standalone `openshell-gateway` binary as a GitHub release asset.

- **Source crate**: `crates/openshell-server`
- **Artifact name**: `openshell-gateway-<target>.tar.gz`
- **Targets**: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`
- **Release workflows**: `.github/workflows/release-dev.yml`, `.github/workflows/release-tag.yml`
- **Installer**: None yet. The binary is a manual-download asset.

Both the standalone artifact and the deployed container image use the `openshell-gateway` binary.

## Python Wheels

OpenShell also publishes Python wheels for `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, and macOS ARM64.

- Linux wheels are built natively on matching Linux runners via `build:python:wheel:linux:amd64` and `build:python:wheel:linux:arm64` in `tasks/python.toml`.
- There is no local Linux multiarch wheel build task. Release workflows own the per-arch Linux wheel production.
- The macOS ARM64 wheel is cross-compiled with `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.python-wheels-macos` via `build:python:wheel:macos`.
- Release workflows mirror the CLI layout: a Linux matrix job for amd64/arm64, a separate macOS job, and release jobs that download the per-platform wheel artifacts directly before publishing.

## Sandbox Images

Sandbox images are **not built in this repository**. They are maintained in the [openshell-community](https://github.com/nvidia/openshell-community) repository and pulled from `ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell-community/sandboxes/` at runtime.

The default sandbox image is `ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell-community/sandboxes/base:latest`. To use a named community sandbox:

```bash
openshell sandbox create --from <name>
```

This pulls `ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell-community/sandboxes/<name>:latest`.

## Local Development

`mise run cluster` is the primary development command. It bootstraps a cluster if one doesn't exist, then performs incremental deploys for subsequent runs.

The incremental deploy (`cluster-deploy-fast.sh`) fingerprints local Git changes and only rebuilds components whose files have changed:

| Changed files | Rebuild triggered |
|---|---|
| Cargo manifests, proto definitions, prebuilt staging script | Gateway + supervisor |
| `crates/openshell-server/*`, `crates/openshell-ocsf/*`, `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.images` | Gateway |
| `crates/openshell-sandbox/*`, `crates/openshell-policy/*` | Supervisor |
| `deploy/helm/openshell/*` | Helm upgrade |

When no local changes are detected, the command is a no-op.

**Gateway updates** are pushed to a local registry and the StatefulSet is restarted. **Supervisor updates** are copied directly into the running cluster container via `docker cp` — new sandbox pods pick up the updated binary immediately through the hostPath mount, with no image rebuild or cluster restart required.

Fingerprints are stored in `.cache/cluster-deploy-fast.state`. You can also target specific components explicitly:

```bash
mise run cluster -- gateway    # rebuild gateway only
mise run cluster -- supervisor # rebuild supervisor only
mise run cluster -- chart      # helm upgrade only
mise run cluster -- all        # rebuild everything
```

To validate incremental routing and BuildKit cache reuse locally, run:

```bash
mise run cluster:test:fast-deploy-cache
```

The harness runs isolated scenarios in temporary git worktrees, keeps its own state and cache under `.cache/cluster-deploy-fast-test/`, and writes a Markdown summary with:

- auto-detection checks for gateway-only, supervisor-only, shared, Helm-only, unrelated, and explicit-target changes
- cold vs warm rebuild comparisons for gateway and supervisor code changes
- container-ID invalidation coverage to verify gateway + Helm are retriggered when the cluster container changes
