//! Cross-platform "die when my parent dies" primitive.
//!
//! The VM driver spawns a chain of subprocesses (compute driver → `--internal-run-vm`
//! launcher → gvproxy + libkrun fork). If any link in that chain is killed
//! with SIGKILL — or simply crashes — the children are reparented to init
//! and survive indefinitely, leaking libkrun workers and gvproxy
//! instances.
//!
//! This module exposes two functions:
//! * [`die_with_parent`] — configure the kernel (Linux) or a helper
//!   thread (BSDs, incl. macOS) to SIGKILL the current process when its
//!   parent dies. Call it from `main` in every subprocess we spawn
//!   along the chain. Idempotent-ish (each call is a full setup — see
//!   the runtime.rs comment at the single call site).
//! * [`die_with_parent_cleanup`] — same as above, but on the BSD path a
//!   best-effort cleanup callback runs *before* this process exits.
//!   This matters when we own a non-Rust child (e.g. gvproxy) that
//!   cannot arm its own procguard; the callback lets us SIGTERM it
//!   first.
//!
//! The Linux path uses `nix::sys::prctl::set_pdeathsig(SIGKILL)`, and
//! the BSD path uses `smol-rs/polling` with its `kqueue::Process` +
//! `ProcessOps::Exit` filter. Both are well-tested library surfaces;
//! we keep only the glue code and the pre-arming parent-liveness
//! re-check.

/// Arrange for the current process to receive SIGKILL if its parent dies.
///
/// On Linux this sets `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` to SIGKILL (via
/// `nix::sys::prctl`). The kernel delivers SIGKILL the moment
/// `getppid()` changes away from the original parent.
///
/// On the BSD family (macOS, FreeBSD, etc.) this spawns a detached
/// helper thread that uses `kqueue` with `EVFILT_PROC | NOTE_EXIT` on
/// the parent PID. When the parent exits the thread calls `exit(1)`,
/// which is sufficient for our use case — we are not a critical daemon
/// that needs to drain state; we are a VM launcher / gRPC driver whose
/// entire job is tied to the parent's lifetime.

/// The cleanup hook is best-effort and async-signal-unsafe — it runs on

/// when we own children that cannot arm their own procguard; the cleanup
/// hook is the only chance we get to send them SIGTERM after the kernel
/// reparents us.
///
/// On Linux the cleanup is a no-op: `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` delivers SIGKILL
/// directly to us, there is no Rust-controlled moment between "parent
/// died" and "we die" in which we could run a callback.
